Replacement SSK board for Yamaha CS15 synthesizer

  This repo contains the Arduino sketch and Eagle .brd/.sch files for Old Crow's
  Yamaha CS15 "SSK board" replacement key assigner project.  The project is meant to be
  open source/open hardware with NON-COMMERCIAL use granted by the author.  All board
  logos and other identifying marks are to be left intact, otherwise enjoy.

  Notes: the board is sized to work as a drop-in replacement with the mounting holes and
  headers positioned in the expected locations.  I might make a more compact general
  use version for 61 keys. This version allow the use of one of two opto types in the
  gate circuit: Sharp PC817 or PC829.  I had a bunch of the latter which is why they
  were made an option.
